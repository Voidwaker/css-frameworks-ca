Description--

## Brief
You have been tasked with producing a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing social media platform. The client application must be attractive and responsive, but you have an otherwise blank slate in terms of theme design language.

Using the provided API and API documentation, create a functioning user interface that allows for viewing, posting, editing and deleting social media content.

Social API routes require authorisation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). You will need to register an account and login to access your token.

To complete the required features, you will also need to make use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.

Using localStorage is highly recommended, especially for storing JWT tokens.

A finished project fulfils the requirements below with an easy to use and error-free user interface.

Required features
The following user stories are required for a passing submission:

User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
Registered user can login
User can view a post content feed
User can filter the post content feed
User can search the post content feed
User can view a post content item by ID
User can create a post content item
User can update a post content item
User can delete a post content item
Additional features
The following user stories are optional:

User can create a comment on a post
User can edit profile media
User can follow/unfollow a profile
User can react to a post content item

## register
here u can register a profile with a @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email, when registrering, you will get a confimation if the registration is successfull, and you will get a error message if the registration was unsucessfull. 

## login
after registring a user, you can take the same email and password and login.

## feed
in the feed page, when you have logged inn, you can create a post (with a title, body,tags(optionale) and media(optionale) further down the page, u can update(edit) a post that you have created,just click on the edit button on the post u want to edit (to get the post id) .you can also delete a post, if you are unhappy, or if u dont want it out there, its simple, just click on the delete button on the post u want to delete (to get the post id so the post can be deleted)
we have a search fuction, if u wanna see 100 posts of "test" just search test or example" 
after that we have a sorting option, where the default is newest, but if you set it to the oldest, the oldests posts (out of the 100 fetched) is being displayed first.
last we have the feed, here you can see the time the posts, the time the have beed posted.

## profile

here you can see your profile 
i did not get time to make the profile page alot of the things was optionale, so hopefully you can atleast edit your bio, and mabye press the follow button.
